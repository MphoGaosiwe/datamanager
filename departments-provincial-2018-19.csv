The Legislature has developed a range of policies pertaining to elected representatives, political parties, staff and various institutional practices in order to guide and regulate the daily implementation of services and projects.  In respect of such policies, the review highlighted the need to ensure that existing shortcomings and weaknesses are identified and that key legislation and good governance principles, are incorporated into the existing policy framework.
