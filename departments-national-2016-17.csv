South Africa,Transport,35,True,"## Vote purpose

_Lead the provision of an integrated, sustainable, reliable and safe transport
system through planning, developing, coordinating, promoting and implementing
transport policies, regulations and strategies._



## Mandate

The Constitution identifies the legislative responsibilities of different
spheres of government with regard to airports, roads, traffic management and
public transport. Transport is a function that is legislated and executed at
the national, provincial and local spheres of government. The implementation
of transport functions at the national sphere takes place through public
entities that are overseen by the department, which are discussed at the end
of the chapter.

  

The 1996 White Paper on Transport defines the different sub-sectors in the
transport sector. Broadly, these are the infrastructure and operations of
rail, pipelines, roads, airports, harbours and the intermodal operations of
public transport and freight. The Department of Transport is responsible for
the legislation and policies for all these sub-sectors.

For the intermodal functions of public transport and freight, the guiding
documents are the National Land Transport Act (2009), the public transport
strategy and the national freight logistics strategy.

The department is therefore responsible for conducting sector research,
formulating legislation and policy to set the strategic direction of sub-
sectors, assigning responsibilities to public entities and other spheres of
government, regulating the sector through setting norms and standards, and
monitoring implementation.
