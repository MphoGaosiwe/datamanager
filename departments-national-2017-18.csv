_Lead the provision of an integrated, sustainable, reliable and safe transport
system through planning, developing, coordinating, promoting and implementing
transport policies, regulations and strategies._



## Mandate

The Constitution identifies the legislative responsibilities of different
spheres of government with regards to airports, road infrastructure, rail,
maritime, road traffic management and public transport. Transport is a
function that is legislated and executed at the national, provincial and local
government levels. The implementation of transport functions at the national
level takes place through public entities that are overseen by the department,
each with a specific delivery mandate, as specified in legislation
establishing these entities.

The 1996 White Paper on Transport defines the infrastructure and operations of
rail, pipelines, roads, airports, harbours, and the intermodal operations of
public transport and freight. The Department of Transport is responsible for
the legislation and policies for all these sub-sectors.

The department is therefore responsible for conducting sector research,
formulating legislation and policy to set the strategic direction of sub-
sectors, assigning responsibilities to public entities and other spheres of
government, regulating through setting norms and standards, and monitoring
implementation.
